"""
Permission constants for Arkon's dual-realm RBAC system.

Format: {resource}:{action}:{scope}
  - scope = "own_dept" → only own department + global resources
  - scope = "all" → all resources

Organization permissions have no scope (they are global admin actions).
Workspace permissions are separate (workspace:view:all for admin override).

All permission strings are defined here as the single source of truth.
Used by: require_permission() in auth_service, Role CRUD, and the frontend UI.
