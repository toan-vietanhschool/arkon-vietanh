# AI Skills

AI Skills are versioned agent packages that employees can access through Claude via MCP. Upload a skill package, assign it to departments or workspaces, and it becomes available in Claude's tool context for employees with the right permissions.

## What is a Skill?

A Skill is a packaged capability — a custom agent, a specialized prompt, or a tool bundle — that your organization develops and distributes through Arkon. Think of it as an internal app store for AI capabilities.

Examples:
- A **document generator** that fills in report templates from structured input
- A **contract reviewer** trained on your organization's legal standards
- A **customer profile builder** that pulls from your CRM data format
- A **translation agent** calibrated to your industry's terminology

Skills are uploaded as packages, versioned, and scoped to specific departments or workspaces. When a scoped employee connects via MCP, their permitted skills are available to Claude automatically.

## Uploading a Skill

**Admin Portal → Skills → Upload Skill**

Required:
- **Name** — human-readable skill name
- **Slug** — URL-safe identifier (e.g. `document-generator`)
- **Package file** — the skill package (format depends on your implementation)
- **Description** — what this skill does

Optional:
- **Department scope** — restrict to specific departments (no departments = global, visible to all)
- **Knowledge type** — associate the skill with a knowledge category

The background skill worker processes the uploaded package. Status progresses: `pending` → `processing` → `active`.

---

## Versioning

Every skill has a version history:
- `current_version` — active version number (integer)
- Each upload or update creates a new `SkillVersion` record with a version hash and storage path
- Changelog notes are optional but recommended

To release a new version:
**Admin Portal → Skills → [skill name] → Upload New Version**

Old versions are preserved. Rolling back to a previous version is available from the version history panel.

## Access control

Skills follow the same dual-realm permission model as documents and wiki:

**Global realm (department-based):**
- No departments assigned → **Global skill** — visible to all employees with `skill:read:own_dept` or higher
- Departments assigned → visible only to employees whose department matches

**Workspace realm:**
- Skills can be scoped to a specific workspace (`scope_type = project`)
- Only workspace members can access workspace-scoped skills

**Permission levels:**
| Permission | What it grants |
|---|---|
| `skill:read:own_dept` | View and use skills in your department + global skills |
| `skill:read:all` | View and use all skills across all departments |
| `skill:create:own_dept` | Upload skills to your department |
| `skill:create:all` | Upload skills to any department |
| `skill:edit:own_dept` | Edit skill metadata in your department |
| `skill:edit:all` | Edit any skill |
| `skill:delete:own_dept` | Delete skills in your department |
| `skill:delete:all` | Delete any skill |

## Skill visibility in MCP

When an employee connects Claude via MCP:
1. Arkon resolves their identity and permission scope
2. Skills accessible to this employee (based on department + workspace membership) are included in the MCP context
3. Claude can reference and use these skills in conversation

Skills that are `processing`, `deprecated`, or `archived` are not surfaced in MCP.
