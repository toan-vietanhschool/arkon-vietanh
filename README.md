# Arkon — Enterprise AI Knowledge Hub

**Connect your organization's knowledge to Claude. Self-hosted, on-premise.**

Arkon is the central layer between your documents and your employees' AI clients. Upload your SOPs, policies, product specs, and internal docs — Arkon compiles them into a structured knowledge wiki and serves it directly to Claude via MCP. Every employee gets the right context, automatically, without copy-pasting.

## The problem

Most organizations adopt AI team-by-team, with no shared knowledge, inconsistent context, and no visibility into what information Claude is actually working with. Every employee manually pastes documents, repeats the same background, and gets different answers depending on what they remembered to include.

Arkon treats your AI client as a managed organizational resource — not a personal chatbot.

## How it works

```
Upload document
      │
      ▼
 Extract text + images (PDF, DOCX, URLs, ...)
      │
      ▼
 LLM Wiki Agent analyzes and writes structured knowledge:
   · Creates / updates wiki pages (entities, concepts, topics)
   · Links related pages via [[wikilinks]]
   · Each new document enriches the same wiki — no duplicates
      │
      ▼
 Wiki stored in PostgreSQL + pgvector
      │
      ▼
 Employee opens Claude → connects via MCP token
 Claude reads compiled wiki, not raw document chunks
```

Knowledge compounds. Every document you add enriches the existing wiki rather than creating isolated fragments. By the time an employee asks Claude a question, the answer has already been synthesized from dozens of sources.

---

## Features

### Knowledge Wiki
Documents are compiled into a persistent, interlinked wiki by an LLM agent — not just indexed. Each page covers a specific entity, concept, or topic. Pages cross-reference each other. The wiki grows smarter as more documents are added.

- Three-panel wiki browser: page tree, content, backlinks & outlinks
- Full-text and semantic search
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Organize by knowledge type (SOP, Product, HR Policy, etc.)
- Version history and rollback for every page
- Draft proposal → editor review → approval workflow

### Workspaces
Cross-functional knowledge contexts for projects, clients, or initiatives.

Create a workspace → add members from any department → attach documents. Each workspace has its own scoped wiki, document list, and member roster. Members see their workspace knowledge automatically through Claude.

- Role-based membership: Viewer, Contributor, Editor, Admin
- Scoped wiki and document management
- Contributors propose wiki edits; editors review and approve

### AI Skills
Upload custom agent packages and make them available to employees through Claude. Skills are versioned, department-scoped, and distributed via MCP.

### MCP Server
Employees connect Claude Desktop (or any MCP client) to Arkon using a personal token. Claude gets access to the compiled wiki, raw source documents, and AI skills — all filtered to the employee's permission scope.

→ See [MCP & Claude](docs/MCP.md) for the full tool reference.

### Access Control
Fine-grained RBAC at department level plus workspace membership roles. Admins define roles with granular permissions; employees inherit access based on department or explicit assignment.

→ See [Access Control](docs/ACCESS-CONTROL.md) for the full permission model.

## Quick Start (Docker)

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Docker Compose, an AI provider API key (Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nduckmink/arkon.git
cd arkon
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — set at minimum:

```env
SECRET_KEY=<run: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))">
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3119** and log in with your admin credentials.

Go to **Settings** → configure your embedding model, LLM, and (optionally) vision model. Then upload your first document from **Knowledge Base**.

→ See [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) for the full walkthrough including development mode.

## Connecting Claude

Once an employee account is created and an MCP token is generated:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arkon": {
      "url": "https://your-arkon-server/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ark_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add this to `claude_desktop_config.json` and restart Claude Desktop. The employee's compiled knowledge is immediately available.

→ See [MCP & Claude](docs/MCP.md) for the complete setup and tool reference.
