"""Add Source.auto_recover_count for stuck-processing sweep

Revision ID: 029
Revises: 028
Create Date: 2026-06-11 12:00:00.000000

Counts how many times a source has been auto-flipped from 'processing' back to
'error' by sweep_stuck_processing_cron. Used to gate manual retries: once a
source has been swept too many times in a row, the retry API blocks further
attempts so a misconfigured LLM provider can't burn tokens in a loop. Reset to
0 whenever the pipeline reaches a successful checkpoint (plan_ready or ready).

(Ported from nduckmink/arkon migration 030 and renumbered to 029 so it chains
off our 028_wiki_search_vector head instead of the fork's diverged 028.)
